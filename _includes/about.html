                    Hack.Commit.Push 2025 comes to the Ostschweiz – and this year, it’s bringing the spirit of Hackergarten with it! We have some big and interesting projects you can work on for all levels, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned veteran.
                    <br/>
                    Hack.Commit.Push is more than just a coding event. It’s a community-driven workshop where we come together to build something meaningful. Whether it’s working on software, designs, improved documentation, or educational materials, we contribute to open source with the goal of submitting a real patch or pull request by the end of the day. In short, we aim to make the world a better place, one commit at a time. So like a Hackergarten but all day instead of one evening.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>Every contribution counts!</b> And you’ll walk away with an unforgettable experience of contributing to a real project.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We kick off at 9:00 with a quick intro. Afterwards, you may either join an open-source project or attend our optional beginner-friendly training of Git/GitHub during the first two hours. Whether you’re a first-time contributor or an experienced developer, there’s something for everyone. We’ll wrap up at 17:00 with a recap and a relaxed apéro to celebrate our achievements!
